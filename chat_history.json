You want to create a React Native + Expo app tailored for Ghanaian senior high school students. The app should focus on making learning easier and more engaging, reminding students of assignments, and facilitating interaction and idea sharing. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Home Screen/Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard displaying upcoming assignments, recent activity from other students, and quick links to learning resources.\n*   **Assignments/Reminders:** A dedicated section for managing assignments, with due dates, reminders, and the ability to mark assignments as complete.\n*   **Community/Forums:** A forum or community section where students can interact, ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F8F8FF` (Almost White - provides a clean and fresh feel)\n    *   Text: `#282828` (Dark Gray - for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#585858` (Medium Gray - for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#FF6B6B` (Salmon - a vibrant and attention-grabbing color for primary actions)\n    *   Secondary: `#4ECDC4` (Turquoise - complements the primary color and adds a sense of calm)\n    *   Accent: `#FFE66D` (Yellow - for highlights and important notifications)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White - for content containers, providing contrast)\n    *   Highlight: `#B2DFDB` (Light Turquoise - subtle highlights for interactive elements)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\", which is the default and provides excellent readability on both iOS and Android.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify the Home Screen:**\n    *   Update `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to include sections for displaying upcoming assignments and recent community activity.\n    *   Add a visually appealing layout with clear sections for each feature.\n    *   Implement the color scheme defined above.\n2.  **Create an Assignments Screen:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/assignments.tsx` to house the assignments screen.\n    *   Include functionality to add, view, edit, and mark assignments as complete.\n    *   Implement reminders using local notifications (Expo Notifications).\n3.  **Implement the Community Forum:**\n    *   Create a new file `app/(tabs)/community.tsx` for the community forum.\n    *   Design a layout for displaying forum posts, allowing students to create new posts, comment on existing ones, and interact with each other.\n4.  **Update Tab Layout:**\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new \"Assignments\" and \"Community\" tabs in the bottom navigation.\n    *   Use appropriate icons for each tab.\n5.  **Remove Modal Demos:**\n    *   Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not relevant to the core functionality of the app.\n\nAfter you implement the plan, make sure the changes are visible for the user.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app for Ghanaian students!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-29T19:09:03.367259"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive learning app for Ghanaian senior high school students!
